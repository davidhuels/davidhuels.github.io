This blog is meant for me as a repository of data analysis and data visualisation in R. I am not a professional Data Scientist but I enjoy doing it. If you find mistakes or have improvements for the code please help yourself at github.

This blog started out on wordpress.com but I always felt it was a little bit too much, since I just have static pages. For this reason I now use jekyll and github to produce and host this blog.
