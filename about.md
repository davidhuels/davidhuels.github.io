This blog is meant for me as a repository of data analysis and data visualisation in R. I am not a professional Data Scientist but I enjoy doing it. If you find mistakes or have improvements for the code please help yourself at github.

This blog started out on wordpress.com but one other reason for starting this blog was to learn a bit about web development. Hence I decided to get hands-on with a more minimal framework. For this reason I now use jekyll and github to produce and host this blog.
