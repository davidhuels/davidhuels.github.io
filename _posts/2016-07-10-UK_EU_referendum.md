Two weeks ago, for the EU referendum I was all ready and set. The original plan was to live update and analyse the Brexit vote in the early morning. I prepared all the data tables and the code and I was ready to go. What I didn’t anticipate was that the UK actually voted to leave.


From an objective point, I shouldn’t have been surprised. The polls in the two weeks running up to the referendum clearly showed that it could go both ways. I think I was just hoping that it would go similar to the Scottish Referendum.

By analysing the data it became obvious why so many people were unprepared for the result. More than in any other election, this time there was a clear split within the regions and the classes in the UK. I personally don’t know a single person who voted to leave, which might have something to do with the fact that I lived in Scotland first and now in London.

More interesting is actually to see, from which party most of the voters for Leave came from. Whereas the GE was voted in each of the ~660 constitutencies, the EU referendum was voted in the ~380 local authority districts. So I recalculated the votes from the General Election 2015 for each area district and then looked how many Labour, Conservative districts voted leave.

From this we can see why the two major parties are in such a crisis at the moment, since both officially supported the Remain campaign. This way of analysis is largely inaccurate, but it tells that certain regions surprised by voting Leave, like the Labour heartlands Middlesbrough and Sunderland. A [YouGov] poll after the referendum showed that 61% of Conservatives voted to Leave, only 35% of Labour voted Leave, which might be more accurate but still has the uncertainties of extrapolating the poll to the whole country.

We will have to see what this Referendum means for Britain and the “EU immigrants” in this country, like me. Personally it still feels like waking up with a hangover, even after two weeks. The R code for the analysis and the graphs can be found on my [github page].
