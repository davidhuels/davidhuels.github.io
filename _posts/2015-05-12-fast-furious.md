Last week I finally made it in the latest Fast and the Furious film. And well…it was ok, but actually most of the time I tried to figure out which of the scenes where played by Paul Walker and which by his brother? Nevertheless, so far this is the most successful and highest rated film of the whole series. Why are they getting so successful?


If you’ve never watched any of the Fast and the Furious films, you might wonder why you should care. Let’s see if I can explain myself without actually talking about the films.
First of all, it is remarkable that this is a film series which just seems to carry on. In fact the 8th version is already planned for 2017. When compared to other film series, we can see that especially the last Fast and the Furious films became increasingly popular. How many other films do you know, where the 5th, 6th or 7th movie is more successfull than the first one? Certainly not American Pie or Rocky.
(I should add, that film series does not include one story told over several movies, like Harry Potter, but rather independent movies with a common theme).

When we look closer at the success (Box office gross) and quality (Rotten Tomatoes rating) of the Fast and the Furious films, we can see that we can broadly summarize them in two groups: Films 1-4 and the more successfull ones film 5-7.

Something in between must have happened, which makes the latest movies different from the early ones. Wikipedia tells us that the director Justin Li produced films 3-6 and that Chris Morgan wrote films 3-7, so that can’t be it.
Initially I wanted to watch all the movies in a row, to quantify some characteristics, like how many times did they use NOS, how many races, how many explosions… But a quick google search revealed that someone had already the pleasure [link][ff_explosions].

What we can see is that the early movies had a higher proportion of old school street races than the newer movies. But more striking is actually the number of guns in the movies, which is massively incrased in the later movies.
So they changed the focus from a street race gang (although gang is the wrong word, since they only talk about family…one of the few recurring themes in all of the movies) and shifted to more action packed blockbusters. Yes, I am not happy with that. We can also see this with the actors that joined in the later movies (Dwayne Johnson from film 5-7 and Jason Statham film 7, both more the type of “The Expendables” than anything else).

The trend to include more action in these movies is not new, and seems to be the trend of our time. Kyle Vanhove counted for his [blog][kyles_blog] the number of explosions in Michael Bay’s movies. Again, we can see a nice positive correlation between the popularity of his films and the number of explosions in it.

Although so far we only talk about correlation, and sometimes there is no connection between storks and birth rate, the trend seems to be clear. More people watch movies with high number of explosions and gun fire, and we get what we want. For the next American Pie movie I expect Stifler’s Mom with a machine gun and approximately 213 explosions. We will see.
